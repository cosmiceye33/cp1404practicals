# REFLECTION

## Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
During the course of the subject the first week of doing estimate was pretty bad as they were not good. However after a few weeks I have learned to give myself a little more time that what I would expect in case of any problems I might run into during the task.

## Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
From reviewing code written by other students its allowed me to understand how to do some parts of the code quicker and discover better ways of completing a task. also after receiving code reviews I can see what other people think of my code and improve through there feedback.

## Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
If I were in charge of the subject I would delay the submission date or the prac as a whole when completing the assignment like task straight after submitting assignment 1. I found it difficult as I had other classes work to complete as well and need to put alot of effort into it to get it complete in the 4 day I had compared to the weeks we had for the assignment.
